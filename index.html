        <h2 id="ss">Form & Function in Great Britain</h2>
        <p class='pleft'>
            The Urban Grammar project describes the British landscape through a series of types that capture the way
            places look like (<i>form</i>) and the activities that take place within them (<i>function</i>). Each type
            is built using millions of
            granular data points and machine learning, producing a distinct and unique character that emerges from a
            combination of traits. We call these bundles of form and function
            <span class='hlg'><i>spatial signatures</i></span>, and they are the core building blocks of the Urban
            Grammar.
        </p>
        <p class='pleft'>
            Below you can find the “<span class='hlg'>pen portraits</span>” of each signature, shorthand descriptions of
            the main characteristics that describe them.

        <div class="pp_left">
            <h3>Wild countryside</h3>

            In “Wild countryside”, human influence is the least intensive. This signature covers large open spaces in
            the countryside where no urbanisation happens apart from occasional roads, cottages, and pastures. You can
            find it across the Scottish Highlands,
            numerous national parks such as Lake District, or in the majority of Wales.

            <h3>Countryside agriculture</h3>

            “Countryside agriculture” features much of the English countryside and displays a high degree of agriculture
            including both fields and pastures. There are a few buildings scattered across the area but, for the most
            part, it is green space.

            <h3>Urban buffer</h3>

            “Urban buffer” can be characterised as a green belt around cities. This signature includes mostly
            agricultural land in the immediate adjacency of towns and cities, often including edge development. It still
            feels more like countryside than urban, but
            these signatures are much smaller compared to other countryside types.

            <h3>Open sprawl
            </h3>

            “Open sprawl” represents the transition between countryside and urbanised land. It is located in the
            outskirts of cities or around smaller towns and is typically made up of large open space areas intertwined
            with different kinds of human development,
            from highways to smaller neighbourhoods.

            <h3>Disconnected suburbia</h3>

            “Disconnected suburbia” includes residential developments in the outskirts of cities or even towns and
            villages with convoluted, disconnected street networks, low built-up and population densities, and lack of
            jobs and services. This signature type is
            entirely car-dependent.

            <h3>Accessible suburbia
            </h3>

            “Accessible suburbia” covers residential development on the urban periphery with a relatively legible and
            connected street network, albeit less so than other more urban signature types. Areas in this signature
            feature low density, both in terms of population
            and built-up area, lack of jobs and services. For these reasons, “accessible suburbia” largely acts as
            dormitories.

            <h3>Warehouse/Park land</h3>

            “Warehouse/Park land” covers predominantly industrial areas and other work-related developments made of
            box-like buildings with large footprints. It contains many jobs of manual nature such as manufacturing or
            construction, and very little population
            live here compared to the rest of urban areas. Occasionally this type also covers areas of parks with large
            scale green open areas.

            <h3>Gridded residential quarters</h3>

            “Gridded residential quarters” are areas with street networks forming a well-connected grid-like (high
            density of 4-way intersections) pattern, resulting in places with smaller blocks and higher granularity.
            This signature is mostly residential but includes
            some services and jobs, and it tends to be located away from city centres.

            “Connected residential neighbourhoods” are relatively dense urban areas, both in terms of population and
            built-up area, that tend to be formed around well-connected street networks. They have access to services
            and some jobs but may be further away from
            city centres leading to higher dependency on cars and public transport for their residents.

            A “dense residential neighbourhood” is an abundant signature often covering large parts of cities outside of
            their centres. It has primarily residential purpose and high population density, varied street network
            patterns, and some services and jobs but
            not in high intensity.

            “Dense urban neighbourhoods” are areas of inner-city with high population and built-up density of a
            predominantly residential nature but with direct access to jobs and services. This signature type tends to
            be relatively walkable and, in the case of some
            towns, may even form their centres.

            <h3>Local urbanity</h3>

            “Local urbanity” reflects town centres, outer parts of city centres or even district centres. In all cases,
            this signature is very much urban in essence, combining high population and built-up density, access to
            amenities and jobs. Yet, it is on the lower
            end of the hierarchy of signature types denoting urban centres with only a local significance.

            “Regional urbanity” captures centres of mid-size cities with regional importance such as Liverpool, Plymouth
            or Newcastle upon Tyne. It is often encircled by “Local urbanity” signatures and can form outer rings of
            city centres in large cities. It features
            high population density, as well as a high number of jobs and amenities within walkable distance.

            Signature type “Metropolitan urbanity” captures the centre of the largest cities in Great Britain such as
            Glasgow, Birmingham or Manchester. It is characterised by a very high number of jobs in the area, high
            built-up density and often high population
            density. This type serves as the core centre of the entire metropolitan areas.

            Concentrated urbanity” is a signature type found in the city centre of London and nowhere else in Great
            Britain. It reflects the uniqueness of London in the British context with an extremely high number of jobs
            and amenities located nearby, as well as
            high built-up and population densities. Buildings in this signature are large and tightly packed, forming
            complex shapes with courtyards and little green space.

            The epitome of urbanity in the British context. “Hyper concentrated urbanity" is a signature type present
            only in the centre of London, around the Soho district, and covering Oxford and Regent streets. This
            signature is the result of centuries of urban
            primacy, with a multitude of historical layers interwoven, very high built-up and population density, and
            extreme abundance of amenities, services and jobs.
